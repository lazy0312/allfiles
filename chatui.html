            <section class="sec1">What is react.js? where it is used?</section>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and JSX syntax for efficient UI development. Commonly used in web development, React powers single-page applications (SPAs), progressive web apps (PWAs), and mobile apps through React Native. Its declarative approach simplifies UI development, making it popular for both small-scale projects and large-scale enterprise applications.</p>

        <section><section class="sec1">what is library?
        </section><p>A library, in the context of software development, is a collection of pre-written code or routines that developers can use to perform common tasks or functions without having to write them from scratch. Libraries typically contain reusable modules, classes, functions, or objects that provide specific functionality, such as handling network requests, manipulating data structures, or creating user interface components. By using libraries, developers can save time and effort by leveraging existing solutions and focusing on higher-level aspects of their projects.</p></section>
        <section><section class="sec1">What are frameworks?</section><p>Frameworks are pre-written codebases that streamline application development by providing structure, tools, and conventions. They abstract away low-level complexities, enforce best practices, and offer ready-made solutions for common tasks, enabling developers to build applications more efficiently and consistently.</p></section>
        <section><section class="sec1">Difference between node.js and express.js?</section><p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. It provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, allowing developers to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.

Express.js, on the other hand, is a minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs, including routing, middleware support, and handling HTTP requests and responses. Express.js simplifies the process of building server-side applications with Node.js by providing a more structured and organized approach to handling web requests and building web services.

In essence, Node.js is the runtime environment, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications with Node.js by providing a set of tools and utilities for handling web-related tasks.</p></section>
        <section><section class="sec1">Difference between Mysql and MongoDB?</section><p>MySQL is a relational database with a structured schema and SQL querying. MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents without a schema. While MySQL integrates natively with Django, MongoDB requires third-party libraries for integration with Django Rest Framework. Choosing depends on data structure and querying needs.</p></section>
