In March 2021, Green scored his maiden double century in first-class cricket, with 251 runs for Western Australia against Queensland in the 2020–21 Sheffield Shield season.[17] In February 2022, Green was named in Australia's Twenty20 International (T20I) squad for their tour of Pakistan.[18] He made his T20I debut on 5 April 2022, for Australia against Pakistan.[19] In August 2022, he took his first ODI five-wicket haul, against Zimbabwe in Townsville.[20] In the first ODI against New Zealand in Cairns, he was named player of the match after making 89 not out in a difficult run chase.[21] In the T20I Series against India, Green scored two half-centuries.[22]
