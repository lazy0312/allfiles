He is considered one of the greatest fielders of all time and among the best all-format batsmen of his era.[1][2][3][4] He is also regarded as one of the most tactically astute and successful captains in all formats of modern cricket.[5][6] In 2015, du Plessis became the first South African to score centuries in all forms of the game. He was named as the South African Cricketer of the Year in 2019.[7]

            One of the most successful international captains of his era with a winning percentage of 73.68 in ODIs,[6] he is the first international captain to defeat Australia in Australia in all three formats of the game[8] and defeat Australia in both Home and Away test series back to back, in 2016 and 2018.[9] In 2016, he also became the first and only international captain to whitewash Australia defeating them 5–0 in a five match ODI series. du Plessis was often called the magic dragon slayer of Australians and 2010s turned out to be a decade when South Africa dominated Australia like no other team in International Cricket.[10]
