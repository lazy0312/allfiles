        Early life
        Dinesh Karthik was born into a Telugu speaking family from Chennai, India.[3] He began playing cricket at the age of 10, after a two-year period of living in Kuwait (where his father worked). Karthik was educated in India, and at Carmel School and Fahaheel Al-Watanieh Indian Private School in Kuwait and finally from eighth standard on studied at Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Egmore in Chennai.[4] He was coached in cricket by his father, who was a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his career was hindered when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to suffer the same fate and trained him hard from an early age.[5] Karthik honed his reflexes at a young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. He was initially a batsman and learned wicket-keeping on the Tamil Nadu youth teams, and Robin Singh considered him very fit.[5]
        
        Karthik steadily ascended the youth ranks. He made his Tamil Nadu under-14 debut in early 1999, and was promoted to the under-19 side at the beginning of the 2000/2001 season.[6] He made his first-class debut for the senior side the following season.
