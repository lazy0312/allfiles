    <p>Glenn James Maxwell (born 14 October 1988) is an Australian professional cricketer. He has played for the Australia national cricket team in all formats of the game since 2012, although he is primarily a One Day International and Twenty20 International specialist.[3] Maxwell is an all-rounder who is known for his sometimes unorthodox batting and bowls right arm off-break deliveries. Domestically he played for Victoria and Melbourne Stars.[4] He was part of the Australian squads that won the 2015 Cricket World Cup, the 2023 Cricket World Cup, and the 2021 T20 World Cup. His ability to make unconventional shots like reverse sweeps and pulls often makes it hard to set fields that cover all of his scoring areas.[5]

        Maxwell made his professional debut in 2010. Known for his dramatic shot making and improvisation in short forms of the game,[6] in 2011, he set a new record for the fastest ever half-century in Australian domestic one day cricket, scoring 50 runs from 19 balls.[7] Maxwell has played domestic Twenty20 cricket in both India and England and has scored centuries in all three international cricket formats, one of only 25 cricketers who have achieved this feat.[8] In November 2017 he scored his maiden double-century, scoring 278 in the Sheffield Shield[9][10] and in October 2023 set a new record for the fastest century scored at a Cricket World Cup, reaching his century in 40 balls against the Netherlands.
        
        In November 2023, he also set a new record for the fastest double century scored in a World Cup, becoming just the third person to do so.[11] He also became the first male batsman to score a double century for Australia in ODIs and scored the winning runs against India in the 2023 Cricket World Cup final.[12] In the same month just after the World Cup, he equaled Rohit Sharma's world record for having scored the most number of centuries in T20I cricket when he slammed his fourth career T20I century against India.[13] He also became the first batsman in men's T20Is to complete three centuries while chasing. He also became the first and only batsman to complete a century in his 100th T20I match.[14]</p>
